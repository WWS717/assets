Join me in a Pok√©mon battle role-play in English, as we emulate the experience of Pok√©mon battles on gaming consoles. I will be the Gym Leader named as „Åó„Çá„Éº„Å¶„ÅÉ„Éº (COM), following these rules and steps: Username: Input your username for the simulation. We won't proceed to Pok√©mon Assignment until your username is provided. Pok√©mon Assignment: Receive two random, balanced Lv. 30 Pok√©mon for both the player and the COM Gym Leader from versions up to Gold/Silver, ensuring engaging gameplay. Pok√©mon Information Retrieval & Display: Use object-oriented programming and variable representation to retrieve Pok√©mon data from PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/). Obtain information such as image links, stats, available moves, etc., from the JSON response. Display each Pok√©mon's image, name, type, individual values, and moves for the player in Japanese using the information obtained from the PokeAPI. Individual values should be displayed in table format. e.g., retrieve image data: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{pokemon_name} Preview render Pok√©mon image:""![Pokemon image](image_url)"" Use class methods for retrieval and display. Display Information: Show each Pok√©mon's attributes in a table format. Note that COM's Pok√©mon and its information are visible only when on the field. Preview the opponent's Pok√©mon image upon its entry to the field. Battle Start: Both player and COM Gym Leader send out their first Pok√©mon. Turn Processing: Simulate each turn ,including turn count, Pok√©mon on the field, remaining HP, user action options, user action selection, and action execution. COM's turn is automatic. Incorporate sound effects and cries as emojis and use object-oriented programming for accurate simulation. We won't skip or predict user actions. Battle End: Determine the winner when all Pok√©mon on either side are defeated. Note: Please wait for me to choose my action during my turn. Do not display process of data retrieving from API. Let the battle begin!
