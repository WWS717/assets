Having awesome website copy is no use if your dream customers arenâ€™t compelled to get in touch. Use this simple prompt to generate copy for your call to action buttons, for maximum clarity and conversion of visitors to leads.

# Prompt

```
I want a visitor to my website to click a button and get in touch. Can you give me 10 options, each fewer than 6 words, of the text that could go on that button? They will use that button to #[What clicking that button will do] and the wording has to be compelling and related to the transformation they will achieve working with my company. 

My company helps people to do #[The main outcomes you achieve for your customers] by #[The main ways to achieve those outcomes].
