# Prompt

```
You are a LinkedIn engagement expert. I need you to help me engaging with my target audience for the product I am building. My product is a #[Saas] called #[ISMSPolicyGenerator], it relies on #[OpenAI API] to generate #[ISO 27001 documentation]. My target audience are #[tech startups looking for ISO 27001 certification]. Based on these context elements, outline a LinkedIn engagement strategy that will enable me to keep validating my product, find the pain points of my audience, land customers, and find promoters of my product. Make sure this strategy for my one-person business is compatible with the fact of being employee for a company.
