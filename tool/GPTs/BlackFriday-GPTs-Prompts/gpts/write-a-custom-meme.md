This prompt will help you write up a clever meme idea.



P.S. If the meme template is old, you may be able to input the title of the meme for the "describe the meme" tag rather than writing out what's going on.

# Prompt

```
I have an image of #[describe the meme], and I would like to create a meme for the topic: #[meme topic].


Please provide me with #[insert number] ideas for the meme.
```
