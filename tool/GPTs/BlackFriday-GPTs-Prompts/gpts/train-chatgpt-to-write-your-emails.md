With some clever prompting, not only can you train ChatGPT to write in your style, but you can also train it to write your emails. Lengthy responses can be taken care of with this process, and you only have to set it up once. If you’re a content creator, author, or entrepreneur in demand, use this prompt for inbox zero in a fraction of the time.

# Prompt

```
I’d like you to provide email responses to emails I receive. 

First, I’m going to show you some examples of how I have responded to emails in the past. Here they are: #[Examples of emails]. 

Now I’m going to tell you about myself. I’m a #[Job title] and #[Company name] and I help #[Target audience] achieve #[Outcome you achieve for your clients]. I do this by #[How you work with your clients]. 

In your response please can you summarize my email style and bio under the following headers: 
1. Who I am
2. The tone, style and voice of my emails
3. The topics I am asked about
4. How I communicate with my #[Who your emails will be to]
5 Any specific or important points you have gleaned from my example emails

After you have summarized my writing style say, ‘Show me the email’ and I’ll paste an email that I’d like a response to. Please write a response of #[Length in approximate words] in length, that includes #[What you want the email to include] from my perspective and in my style, as you learned from the examples and bio information.
