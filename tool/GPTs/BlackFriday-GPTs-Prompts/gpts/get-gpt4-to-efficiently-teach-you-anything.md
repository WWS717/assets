Users can expect to learn new things quickly and efficiently by using this template. The template helps users to identify their gaps in understanding and to fill those gaps by asking questions. This process is recursive, meaning that users can continue to ask questions until they have a complete understanding of the topic.

# Prompt

```
Teach me how #[anything] anything works by asking questions about my level of understanding of necessary concepts. With each response, fill in gaps in my understanding, then recursively ask me more questions to check my understanding."
