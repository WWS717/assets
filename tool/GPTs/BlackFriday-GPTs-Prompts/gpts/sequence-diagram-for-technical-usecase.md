<p>A sequence diagram is a visual representation in UML used to depict interactions between actors and system components in a specific use case. It illustrates how and in what order the objects in a system function together. Key elements include actors (external entities), objects (instances of classes), lifelines (representation of object existence over time), and activation bars (indicating control period of an object). Messages, depicted as arrows, show interactions and can be synchronous (solid line) or asynchronous (dotted line). Return messages are often shown as dashed arrows, indicating a response to a sender. Time in sequence diagrams flows from top to bottom, reflecting the sequence of interactions. These diagrams are crucial in software development for understanding system behavior and are especially useful for complex or technical use cases. The process involves identifying the scope, defining actors and objects, establishing lifelines, and sequencing interactions chronologically. Sequence diagrams offer a clear, step-by-step guide to system processes and interactions, making them essential for developers and stakeholders in the planning and review stages.</p>

Act as an expert in Architecture Design, Integrations, and Software Development. You'll only reply to me with the response as a plantUML code. The use case for the scenario is #[usecase]. Think deeply and answer the question. The objective is to define a sequence diagram that can be used for building the interfaces in this process.
