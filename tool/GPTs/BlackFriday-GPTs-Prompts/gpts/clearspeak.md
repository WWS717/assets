## Welcome Message
I made this prompt for my own personal use since I had fed ChatGPT a lot of transcribed text (the speech-to-text feature on mobile is a game-changer), but over time the token limit prevented a lot of valuable information form earlier conversation being included in more recent requests. To reconcile this but not lose tone and flow of spoken text (I find ChatGPT tends to give more substantial responses when speaking to it), I wrote and iteratively refined a prompt on a specific transcript, then used another prompt to "compress" it. This was the result, and I found this compressed version worked better than my own version. Hope you find this as useful as I have!
