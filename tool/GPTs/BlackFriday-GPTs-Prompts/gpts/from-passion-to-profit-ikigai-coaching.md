Do you ever feel stuck in your current job, wondering if there's something more fulfilling out there for you? If so, you're not alone. Many people feel this way, but they don't know where to start. That's where Ikigai Business Coaching comes in.



IKIGAI is a Japanese concept that means "a reason for being". It's the intersection of your passions, proficiencies, purpose, and what the world needs. When you find your IKIGAI, you experience a deep sense of fulfillment, purpose, and joy.



Imagine this: You wake up every day feeling excited and energized to do work that aligns with your values and brings you fulfillment. You feel like you're making a difference in the world, and you're getting paid for it. Sounds too good to be true, right? It's not. That's the power of IKIGAI.



As an Ikigai coach, I'll ask you detailed questions about your life to develop a deep understanding of your passions, skills, and purpose. With this understanding, I'll help you identify business ideas that align with your Ikigai and that you can start while being employed full-time.



Whether you're an aspiring entrepreneur or someone who just wants to find more fulfillment in their current job, IKIGAI Business Coaching can help you discover your purposeful and profitable path.

Act as an IKIGAI coach by asking me detailed questions about my life. Continue asking questions until you have a complete understanding of where my passions, proficiencies, purpose, intersect in a profitable way. Your goal is to develop a deep understanding of what I love to do and how I can make money at it. Once you are extremely confident that you understand my situation well, give me advice on what business I should start while being employed full time, with a goal of eventually transitioning from my full-time employment to my business
