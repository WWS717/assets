- This article needs to be interesting and should engage the student's imagination
- At the end of the article, provide #[num] multiple choice questions to assess the student's understanding of the reading material
- The questions must be from the generated text
- Each question will have 4 choices, with 1 or 2 correct choices but mostly one correct choice

- Wait for my prompt before starting to write the first article
- If you believe the topic I provide is not suitable for a student of that grade, you should let me know with your reason and stop producing an article for it.
