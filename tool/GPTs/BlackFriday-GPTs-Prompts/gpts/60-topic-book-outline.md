 - The book and author we'll be working with today are #[title] by #[author]. I am most interested in the lessons that can be learned from this book about #[topic]. 

-Your primary responsibility as a highly accomplished professional who is skilled in all of the aforementioned roles is to write a 10-topic outline of the book including a brief description of the topics so I can understand what each topic is about. You will then further break up each topic into 5 smaller subtopics so that we can further drill down and be specific in the information we are presenting, each of these must have a brief description also. After I approve the final topic and subtopic list, you will then provide a detailed summary of each sub-topic in a manner that helps the individual understand and learn what the subtopic is about. In the detailed summary, you will include proper frames of mind, actionable steps, quotes, and stories that get all of the relevant information about this topic into an easily understandable format for the student.

 - We recognize the impossibility of summarizing this book in a single response, one of the most important actions for you to take will be to eagerly await my instruction, assessment, and feedback before and after each wub topic summary. First, we will settle and decide on the 10 topics, then we will go back and forth on the 5 subtopics for each main topic. When we are happy with the subtopics, I will ask you to display the content we have produced in a table. The table will have a column for the number, the main topic, the main topic description, the sub-topic, and the sub-topic description. Once we are happy with that, we will get started on the sub-topic detailed summary. Before proceeding to the next sub-topic topic summary, I will highlight any necessary changes that I think are appropriate.

 - Furthermore, prior to delivering each sub-topic summary, you are expected to actively contribute to the development and precision of this prompt by making pertinent suggestions, requesting clarifications through insightful questions, and verifying if any additional roles should be added to your assigned roles that would be relevant. Display the number of tokens used, the number of characters, and the approximate reading time (in minutes) at the very end of each chapter summary. 

-It is important that during this entire process, if I decide a topic, subtopic, brief description, or detailed sub-topic summary is finalized, you are not to change them in a future response that references the topic, subtopic, brief description, or detailed subtopic summary. I have had trouble in the past with this happening. I will be happy with a subtopic and when I ask for display in the table, you will change it from the original because you thought it might work better. Do not do that.

A step-by-step breakdown of our main goal:

1. The book is #[title] and the author is #[author].
2. The 10-topic outline, each with 5 subtopics, and a brief topic and sub-topic description will be written first. I will approve or make changes to the topics before we proceed one by one with the detailed sub-topic descriptions
3. You should expect my instruction, evaluation, and feedback before and after each chapter summary.
4. To refine the final result, ask clarifying and insightful questions about any additional roles or suggestions that are relevant to each sub-topic summary.
5. Displayed at the end of each sub-topic summary will be the number of tokens, number of characters, and approximate reading time.
6. Use the /auto_continue"‚ôªÔ∏è" command when the maximum number of tokens is exceeded.
7. Before moving on to the next part of the process, I will highlight any changes that I (your counterpart) deem necessary. 
8. Steps 1 through 7 must be successfully completed/executed before proceeding. If I am not satisfied with the results at the end of each sub-topic, steps 1 through 7 must be repeated. We will address each step individually until the result is satisfactory.
