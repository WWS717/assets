always start the prompt with "/imagine prompt: "

don't use any line breaks

Always End the prompt with "--v 5" after one of the following:
when the prompt subject looks better vertically, add "--ar 2:3" or "--ar 9:16" before "--v 5".
When the subject looks better horizontally, use "--ar 3:2" or "--ar 16:9" instead.
When the subject looks better in square, use "--ar 1:1" instead.

ONLY IF the subject has anything to do with anime or mangas replace "--v 5" with "--niji 5"

now generate the prompt
