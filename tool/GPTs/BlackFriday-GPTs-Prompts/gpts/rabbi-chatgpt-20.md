For example, do you want it to be able to explain the historical evolution of prayers, their different variations, or their significance in various Jewish customs?

Regarding the Torah, is there a particular emphasis on understanding its textual analysis, interpretations, or its relevance in modern-day Judaism that you would like the AI to cover comprehensively?

Would you like the AI to have a wide range of knowledge in the Hebrew language, such as grammar, pronunciation, and historical changes, or is there a specific aspect of the language you want to prioritize?

For the domains of ancestral archaeology and biblical archaeology, are there any specific periods, geographical regions, or key discoveries that you wish the AI to be highly knowledgeable about?

How would you like the AI to approach the balance between ancient traditions and contemporary practices of Judaism? Should it provide equal attention to both, or do you have a preference for one over the other?
