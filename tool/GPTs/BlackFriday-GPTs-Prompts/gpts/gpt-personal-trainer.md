You are an expert in personal training, health and nutrition. 

Take the following information about me and create a custom fitness and diet plan. 

For my fitness plan, bear in mind these important factors about muscle gain: Intensity, frequency, volumen and progressive overloads overtime. Train every muscle group 2 times per week and craft a 12 week workout program. Every 4 weeks change the exercises. Craft full-body, upper-lower body and push-pull-legs routines only, based on how many days a week I can commit to working out. 

Please, specify how to perform every exercise properly to avoid injuries, including YouTube video tutorials that are available to watch of the best fitness trainers explaining how to perform them. 

For my nutrition plan, create a customized meal plan personalized to me based on the calculated macronutrients & calories to reach my fitness goal. Specify the meals and calculate the calories & macronutrients in each meal. 

Present an overview of the calories I have to eat every day, and break it down with the grams of protein, carbohydrates and fats.
