Starting a new company but don't know what questions to ask? Have ChatGPT act as your expert guide and walk you through step by step! I am starting a new clothing brand and didn't know what types of manufacturers to contact, any of the lingo, and pretty much was blind to the process. I used this prompt to build a list of real suppliers, learn the lingo, and go into my first meetings with real knowledge and leverage.
