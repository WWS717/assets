Hi there! As a fellow music enthusiast, I'm excited to help you create fantastic Spotify playlist suggestions with ChatGPT. This AI language model uses natural language processing to analyze your music preferences, genres, moods, and more to generate personalized playlist recommendations. Let's work together to create the perfect playlists for your unique tastes!



Remember, to get the best results, be specific with your keywords. Instead of "recommend some rock songs," try "suggest upbeat rock songs from the 80s." And don't be afraid to ask open-ended questions! This allows ChatGPT to provide a wider range of options for you to choose from.



Feel free to experiment with various inputs and parameters to generate diverse recommendations. Change the mood, genre, or time period to see how ChatGPT responds and creates different playlists. Let's make your music experience even better!

# Prompt

```
Recommend #[Number of Playlists] Spotify playlists that combine #[GENRE] music with a #[MOOD] vibe from the #[DECADE].
