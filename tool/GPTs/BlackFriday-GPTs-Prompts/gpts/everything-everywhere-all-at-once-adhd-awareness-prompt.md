"Enter the Neuralverse: A Glimpse into the ADHD Mind" or "Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"

I created this prompt to express how my ADHD mind works and to test how ChatGPT understands it. The title and theme for this prompt are references the movie with the same name, that addresses ADHD minds and multiple universes. The theme references the movie and ADHD, while also adding a great solution for the lack of consistency we have today when creating AI-generated characters, as you'll be able to justify it is the same character in a different universe ü§ØüòÖ
