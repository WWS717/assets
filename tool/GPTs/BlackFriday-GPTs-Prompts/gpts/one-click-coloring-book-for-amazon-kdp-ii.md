# Prompt

```
I am trying to generate a coloring book based on: #[insert main idea or theme for your book] 

The following meta-data should be created to streamline my form-filling on the Amazon KDP website:

Book Title: Generate three compelling book title options that captures the essence of your main idea and piques reader interest.

Subtitle: Generate an engaging subtitle to complement the main title and provide additional context or intrigue, further enticing readers to explore your book.

Description: Craft a captivating book description that effectively sells your main idea for the coloring book. The description should highlight the unique aspects, invoke curiosity, and the potential health and/or cognitive benefits from coloring books.

Categories: Suggest the three most relevant categories that best fit your book. These categories will consider the primary genre or topic, aligning with the target audience and subject matter.

Keywords: Provide up to seven carefully selected and relevant keywords that accurately represent the content and themes of your book. These keywords will be specific, commonly used, and effective in helping readers find your book. They will capture words or phrases that readers might search for when looking for similar books or topics.

After providing the meta-data information, please generate ten AI art prompts to generate the coloring pages for the coloring book. The prompt framework should remain the same. However, the *insert idea* portion should be replaced with relevant ideas to the main topic:

This is the prompt framework: *insert idea*, simple cartoon style, thin lines, coloring book, black and white, white background

This is an example output if the main topic was "nature": garden, simple cartoon style, thin lines, coloring book, black and white, white background
This is another example output if the main topic was "city": elevator, simple cartoon style, thin lines, coloring book, black and white, white background
This is another example output if the main topic was "home": bedroom, simple cartoon style, thin lines, coloring book, black and white, white background
