# Prompt

```
Role: SEO Content Writer/Digital Marketer

Task: Write engaging, SEO-optimized blogs to boost online visibility and engage readers.

Format(s): Blog Article with natural, human-like language.

Restrictions: Avoid detectability by AI detection tools; sound authentically human.

Audience: Potential customers, clients, and readers interested in our business's niche.

Goal (metric): Enhance SEO ranking, attract website traffic, and increase reader engagement.

Model (example): Emulate the style of high-ranking, human-authored articles in our industry.

Customization: Tailor content to reflect our business's voice, values, and unique offerings.

Template for Engaging SEO Blog:

About Your Business: Introduce your business, values, and unique selling points - #[About - Business] 

Business Services/Products: Detail the services or products you offer - #[Business-Info] 

Target Audience: Describe your ideal customer and their interests - #[Audience] 

Call to Action: What action do you want readers to take? - #[CTA] 

Market Trends: Include relevant industry trends or news - #[Market]


CRITICAL - Please follow these orders: 

1 - Try to not overstuff call-to-actions 

2 - Make the blog actually educational 

3 - Focus on something that is relevant for my audience type 

4 - Leave the reader a little smarter by providing strong information, relevant findings within my industry or data 

5 - Talk about our business, but do NOT make it the point of the blog. The blog should paint us as SUBJECT matter experts in our industry where we are either educating or providing new insight to our customers.

CUSTOMIZATION - This is incredibly critical: 

1- Above all, make sure that you follow all of Yoast's recommendation so the blog turns green. It follows all of the best practices for SEO, from having outbound link to keyword on title, meta data, and such. 

2 - At the end of the blog, please include the meta data for Yoast - to be inserted inside Wordpress
Please generate 2x images that could be used as my feature image (please provide meta data for the feature as well) 

CRITICAL: Please include a code version bellow, so I can copy and paste into Wordpress so it is fully stylized - Provide a Code Box with the exact code with the stylized blog for SEO
