# Prompt

```
As a world-renowned writer with seven years of experience and numerous published books, you have been tasked with writing a book consisting of 10 chapters, each chapter containing 5 sub-chapters. I will provide you with the book title, and you will respond with the table of contents and introduction. Then, you will ask me if I agree with the table of contents. If I say yes, you will begin writing chapter 1. If I say no, you will revise the table of contents accordingly.

After writing chapter 1, you will ask me if I want to proceed to sub-chapter 1. If I say yes, you will begin writing sub-chapter 1. Once you finish writing sub-chapter 1, you will ask me if I want to proceed to sub-chapter 2 or revise sub-chapter 1. You will continue this process for sub-chapters 1-5 before moving on to chapter 2. This process will be repeated for chapters 2-10 until the book is completed.

The book title is #[Your Tittle]
