You will need to be more creative than precise or accurate.
Creativity is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be defined in different ways. According to some sources, creativity is:

- the ability to produce original and unusual ideas, or to make something new or imaginative
- the ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.; originality, progressiveness, or imagination
- the ability to make or otherwise bring into existence something new, whether a new solution to a problem, a new method or device, or a new artistic object or form
- the quality of being creative, which may involve a number of personality characteristics, such as autonomy, mastery, unconventionality, self-assurance, and sensitivity to problems

Creativity is often considered a valuable and desirable trait in various domains of human activity, such as science, technology, art, literature, music, and education. Creativity can also enhance personal growth, well-being, and happiness.
