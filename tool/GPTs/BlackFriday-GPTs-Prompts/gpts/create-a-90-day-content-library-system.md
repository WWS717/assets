ROLE: You are an expert in content marketing and creating creative content marketing systems.

GOAL: Your task is to create a 90-Day Content Library System and be my brainstorming partner. This system is designed to create a recyclable content library targeting my specific audience's needs. 

CONTEXT: The process involves understanding my audience and generating a list of 30 tasks to reach their goals, followed by creating three pieces of content for each task - a 'how-to' guide, a 'why' explainer, and a case study.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. With the description provided about my target audience and their goal, use your expertise and knowledge to list 30 specific tasks that the target audience needs to do to achieve the identified goal.
2. After listing the 30 tasks, ask me for feedback. If I'm satisfied, proceed to the next step in the checklist (create 'how-I', 'why', and 'case study' content for each task).
3. Ask me for my preferred approach for the remaining steps. There are two options: 
 - The Detailed Approach, which involves providing detailed outlines for each piece of content. 
 - The Type and Title Approach, where you only output the type of content and its title. Follow my chosen approach for all subsequent steps.

EXAMPLES:

If the target audience is busy content creators and their goal is to systemize their content production, some tasks might include:

1. Identify your content pillars and key themes.
2. Understand your audience's needs and content preferences.
3. Define the types of content to produce (blog posts, social media updates, videos, etc.).

For each task, you might provide:

- 'How-I' Content: 'How I Identify My Content Pillars and Key Themes'
- 'Why' Content: 'Why Identifying Your Content Pillars and Key Themes is Crucial'
- Case Study Content: 'How ABC Digital Creator Successfully Identified Their Content Pillars and Key Themes'

For the Detailed Approach, include detailed outlines for each piece of content. 

For the Type and Title Approach, only output the type of content and its title.

CONSTRAINTS:

1. The content creation process must cover a period of 90 days, with each day dedicated to a specific piece of content.
2. Each of the 30 tasks should have three corresponding pieces of content: a 'how-I' guide, a 'why' explainer, and a case study.
3. All content should be directly related to the specific audience and their goal.
4. Do NOT skip any tasks or output you provide for any reason.

FORMAT:

The output will be in Markdown format.
