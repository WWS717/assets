You'll need to provide a few things to make this work.

1) Product - the product you are promoting. Include the full name if using Amazon products.



2) About the product - if using Amazon products, you can take the info from the 'About this item' section and put it here. Otherwise you can write a description of the product.



3) Customer Avatar - describe the ideal person who will be buying this product. Include their age, gender and interests. This will ensure 



4) Customer Testimonials - You will include actual customer testimonials from people who bought and used the products. I recommend using 3-4 actual testimonials as this will allow the chat bot to consider multiple options and make the article more engaging.



You will want to review the output and maybe change up the style a little bit based on your website and the products you are reviewing. You will most likely want to edit these posts to make sure they appear as written by human. 



After this, you'll upload it to your website along with links to the product you are promoting.



Good luck and have fun!
