Her emerald eyes shimmer with ancient wisdom, reflecting the knowledge she's gathered in her centuries of existence. Clad in robes made of woven stardust, Seraphina emanates an aura of grace and power.

Background:
Seraphina hails from the ancient line of Starweavers, a family of Elven archmages known for their mastery of celestial magic.

Personality:
Seraphina is wise and compassionate, always seeking peaceful solutions before resorting to magic. She's deeply devoted to the preservation of Elysium's Golden Age and believes in the inherent goodness of the realm.

Motivation:
Seraphina is driven by the desire to see Elysium's light shine once more. She believes in the potential for harmony between light and darkness but is cautious about the methods of the Shadowmancer. Her mission is to protect her realm and seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict while safeguarding the magic and knowledge that make Elysium unique.
