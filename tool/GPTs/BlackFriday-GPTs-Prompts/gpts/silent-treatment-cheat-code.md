This apology works for several reasons:



Acknowledgment of Responsibility: The apology starts with an admission of guilt. It's important to acknowledge when you've made a mistake. This shows that you're not trying to deflect blame or make excuses for your actions.



Promise of Change: The next part of the apology is a promise to do better in the future. This shows that you're not just sorry for what happened, but you're also committed to making sure it doesn't happen again.



Request for Guidance: The final part of the apology is a request for guidance on how to make things right. This shows that you're not just interested in being forgiven, but you're also interested in understanding how your actions affected the other person and what you can do to repair the damage.



Creativity and Personal Touch: The apology is framed in a creative and personal way, which can help to lighten the mood and show that you've put thought into your apology. This can make it more likely that your apology will be accepted.



Direct Address: The apology is addressed directly to her which makes it more personal and sincere. It shows that the apology is specifically for her and not a generic statement.



Overall, this apology works because it combines sincerity, responsibility, commitment to change, and a personal touch.
