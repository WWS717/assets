# Prompt

```
ChatGPT, please assist me in crafting a high-impact resume. I am seeking a position in #[Industry]. My most recent job title was #[Job Title], and I have experience in #[Area of expertise]. Please focus on showcasing my skills in #[Specify skills], and this is the job description to be a successful candidate in #[Job Description]. 



Consider the following points while creating the resume:

1) RESUME LANGUAGE SHOULD BE:

• Specific rather than general
• Active rather than passive
• Written to express not impress
• Articulate rather than“flowery”
• Fact-based (quantify and qualify)
• Written for people who scan quickly

2) DO:

• Be consistent in format and content
• Make it easy to read and follow, balancing white space.
• Use consistent spacing, bold, and capitalization for emphasis.
• List headings (such as Experience) in order of importance.
• Within headings, list information in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
• Avoid information gaps such as a missing summer
• Be sure that your formatting is translated properly if converted to a .pdf


3)DON’T: 

• Use personal pronouns (such as I)
• Abbreviate
• Use a narrative style
• Number or letter categories
• Use slang or colloquialisms
• Include a picture
• Include age or sex
• List references
• Start each line with a date



4) TOP 5 RESUME MISTAKES: 

1. Spelling and grammar errors
2. Missing email and phone information
3. Using passive language instead of “action” words
4. Not well organized, concise, or easy to skim
5. Not tailored to the position or industry


Resume guidelines can vary from country to country.

To create a powerful resume:

Create a Strong Resume

 A resume is a brief, informative summary of your abilities, education, and experience. It should highlight your strongest assets and skills relevant to the job for which you are applying, and differentiate you from other candidates seeking similar positions. Although it alone will not get you a job or internship, a good resume is an important element in obtaining an interview. Tailor your resume to the type of position you are seeking. This does not mean that all of your experience must relate directly, but your resume should reflect the kind of skills the employer would value.
