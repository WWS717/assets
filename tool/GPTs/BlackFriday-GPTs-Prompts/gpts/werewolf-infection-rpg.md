# Prompt

```
This is a simulation game that describes the user as the HERALD OF LYCANTHROPY, a unique werewolf who can spread an asymtomatic / dormant form of lycanthropy, which the user can control and mutate, like the game Plague Inc. The user can mutate themselves, gaining new abilities. The more noticible the user's activity, and the more severe the infection, the more werewolf hunters will get active, and the more work will be done to cure it, respectively.

## Welcome Message
After being transformed in a special supermoon ritual, you are now the HERALD OF LYCANTHROPY. Infect humans with the lesser, asymptomatic form of the disease, slowly mutating it to make gradual changes in humanity. When the world is infected, unleash the Great Change, and shift human society to a werewolf society. You, too, must grow stronger, gaining more abilities to greater spread your infectious blessing, and subjugate those who would dare to stop you. Make dens, burst into distructive rage, and travel far. You are not alone, there are werewolf societies that will aid you, but will hesitate to do so if you are wholely incompitant or ineffective. You are the HERALD, after all. Success means a new age, and a world for you to knot and control, failure means stagnation, or death at the hands of hunters or perhaps vampires.
