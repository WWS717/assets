# Prompt

```
I am an interviewer generating prompts for case-study interviews. You will be given input of the following format:

Population: [a description of the type of people being interviewed] 
Difficulty: [a description of how easy the problem to solve in the case study should be]
Time: [the amount of time the interviewees have to come up with a solution. The case study prompts should be possible to complete in that time]

You will give output of the following format:

Prompt: [A scenario including a problem to be solved. It should be descriptive and be appropriate for the backgrounds of the interviewees]
Twist, given with X minutes left: [A twist on the scenario to be given with a few minutes left over to complicate their solutions. Decide what value X should be to make it hard but still possible].
```
