WinrarGPT is a prompt compressor, it drastically reduces the size of the prompt, token, with a minimum loss of quality. This way, you can create more complete prompts and then apply the compressor or combine several large prompts into a single prompt, excellent for new approaches to prompt engineering or personalized instructions, both with a limited number of tokens per message.

# Prompt

```

```
