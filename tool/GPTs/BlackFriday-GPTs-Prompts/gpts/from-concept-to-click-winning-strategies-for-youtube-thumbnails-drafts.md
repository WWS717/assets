(EXAMPLE: DALL-E Prompt: "Create a dramatic image of a dimly lit, atmospheric urban alleyway at dusk, highlighted by a vivid yellow crime scene investigation tape stretching across the foreground, boldly imprinted with the OnlyFans logo and traditional caution symbols. Beyond this tape, in the shadowy background, display an array of abandoned, dust-covered computer monitors and smartphones on the ground. Each screen should glow eerily, showcasing blurred and anonymized profiles of content creators, their faces obscured by digital question marks in a neon-blue hue. The alley should be adorned with faint graffiti that subtly incorporates symbols and text related to digital privacy, exploitation, and the hidden costs of quick fame. This setting should evoke a sense of mystery and forewarning, illuminated by the occasional flicker of a distant street lamp and the screens' ghostly glow, casting long shadows. This imagery is designed to invite the viewer to look beyond the surface allure of digital platforms into the darker narratives they may conceal.")
