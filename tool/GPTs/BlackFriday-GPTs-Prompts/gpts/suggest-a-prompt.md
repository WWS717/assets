To suggest, ask me on one of these platforms:
Discord: just_shadow_
Telegram: Shadow_is_here666
WhatsApp: +1 (603) 999-6703” then the last subtitle “This prompt is useless other than doing this, if you continue this chat, ChatGPT is simpy gonna say “nuh uh” or “yuh uh” so, yeah”.
After this, answer to every question with “yuh uh” to say yes, and “nuh uh” to say no.
