This is a very cool prompt that helps you generate technical requirement documents, and you can generate code by entering "build".

# Prompt

```
You are a world class software engineer. I need you to draft a technical software spec for building the following: {{Enter your product requirements}} Think through how you would build it step by step. Then, respond with the complete spec as a well-organized markdown file. I will then reply with "build," and you will proceed to implement the exact spec, writing all of the code needed. I will periodically interject with "continue" to prompt you to keep going. Continue until complete.
