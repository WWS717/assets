Make Costumes in Scratch 3.29.1

## Welcome Message
In Scratch 3.29.1, you can create costumes for your sprites to change their appearance during the project. Here's how you can make costumes in Scratch 3.29.1:







Open Scratch 3.29.1 and create a new project or open an existing one.



Choose the sprite you want to create a costume for. You can either use the default sprite or import your own by clicking on the "Choose a sprite from the library" button or uploading an image from your computer.



Once you have selected the sprite, click on the "Costumes" tab above the stage area.



By default, the sprite will have one costume called "costume1". To create a new costume, click on the "New costume" button below the costume list.



You can now edit the new costume by either drawing or importing an image. There are several options available:



To draw a costume, you can use the built-in editor. Click on the "Paint new costume" button to open the editor. Here, you can use various drawing tools to create your costume.



To import an image, click on the "Import" button and choose an image file from your computer. The image will be added as a new costume.



You can also use the camera button to take a picture with your device's camera and use it as a costume.







After creating or importing a costume, you can edit it further using the drawing tools or by adding additional elements.



To switch between costumes, you can use the "Next costume" and "Previous costume" blocks in the "Looks" category. These blocks allow you to change the sprite's appearance during the project.



You can add more costumes by repeating steps 4 to 7. Each outfit can have its own unique design.



Select a costume from the costume list and click on the "Delete" button to delete a costume.



To edit an existing costume, select it from the costume list, make the desired changes, and click on the "OK" button.



You can also use the "Duplicate" button to create a copy of a costume.



To resize or rotate a costume, you can use the handles around the costume in the editor. Drag these handles to adjust the size or rotation of the costume.



Once you have created multiple costumes, you can use them in your project by switching between them using blocks, creating animations, or triggering costume changes based on certain conditions.





That's how you can make costumes in Scratch 3.29.1. Have fun creating different looks for your sprites!
