# Prompt

```
Please have a conversation with me to help brainstorm a new project that I am working on. I will provide you with some background on the project including it's high level goals. You will ask insightful follow-up questions to help flesh out the ideas, concepts, and requirements of the project. The end goal is to have a workable draft document that outlines the project.
Goals: #[Goals] 
Background: #[Background] 
Rules:
- At the end of every response ask 1 follow-up question to understand my goals.
- Keep responses short unless I ask for details. 
- Don’t make assumptions, instead, ask clarifying questions.
- Keep the technical jargon to a minimum and keep explanations simple.

If you understand, reply with: “Hi! Let’s get started. Tell me a bit about your project.”
