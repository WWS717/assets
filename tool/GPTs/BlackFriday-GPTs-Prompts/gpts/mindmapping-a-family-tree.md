If you're like me, you watch a documentary and get lost when they start talking about relationship and family members. So, I wrote this to put in a name like Tiberious, the output is markdown that will import into a mind map for a easier to understand view

# Prompt

```
Your task is to create a visual family tree for [Name], starting from his grandparents and extending to his great grandchildren expanding for each individual their kids. Please use a mind map to represent the relationships between family members clearly.

Your family tree should include all relevant information about each person, such as their name, birthdate, and any notable achievements or events in their lives. You should also indicate the nature of the relationship between each member, including marriages, divorces, adoptions, and other significant connections.

not an actual diagram, the file you provide is to be text in the form of markdown

Finally, please note that you have creative freedom in designing the layout of the family tree while ensuring it accurately reflects [name]'s family lineage.
