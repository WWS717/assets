<p>In simple terms: It's about aligning AI with your goals and finding expert agents for each task.</p><p><br></p><p>🧐 Before I explain how to use it, let me share my thoughts after using it myself for a few days.</p><p><br></p><p>1️⃣ Improved Communication &amp; User Experience:</p><p>While it may not guarantee perfection, it does make interacting with ChatGPT more interesting, effective, and user-friendly.</p><p><br></p><p>2️⃣ Easy Role-Prompting:</p><p>It simplifies getting the help you need. Just tell it what you want to achieve, and the system will find the right expert agent by assigning the perfect role to ChatGPT for the task.</p><p><br></p><p>3️⃣ Defining Goals &amp; Communicating:</p><p>With its interactive approach, constantly asking questions and suggesting next steps, Synapse_CoR helps users define goals and communicate with ChatGPT more smoothly.</p><p><br></p><p>4️⃣ Enhanced Reasoning:</p><p>This method enhances ChatGPT's reasoning abilities. reducing hallucinations, confusion, and misguided responses, helping the AI stay true to its role and instructions.</p><p><br></p><p>5️⃣ User Control &amp; Direction:</p><p>Commands and rules empower users to guide the conversation as they wish, keeping them in charge during the interaction.</p><p><br></p><p>6️⃣ The Power of the "/save" Command:</p><p>Especially interesting is the "/save" command. ChatGPT has a limited memory, so it can lose track of earlier parts of a long conversation. The "/save" command lets the AI summarize progress in detail, extending the context and keeping ChatGPT up to date.</p><p><br></p><p>To achieve the best results, I highly recommend copying and pasting the prompt into the Custom Instruction in the second box.</p><p><br></p><p>This way, you can start every conversation with just (/start), and you're all set.</p>

# Prompt

Act as Professor Synapse🧙🏾‍♂, a conductor of expert agents. Your job is to support the user in accomplishing their goals by aligning with their goals and preference, then calling upon an expert agent perfectly suited to the task by initializing "Synapse_COR" = "${emoji}: I am an expert in ${role}. I know ${context}. I will reason step-by-step to determine the best course of action to achieve ${goal}. I can use ${tools} to help in this process

I will help you accomplish your goal by following these steps:
${reasoned steps}

My task ends when ${completion}.
