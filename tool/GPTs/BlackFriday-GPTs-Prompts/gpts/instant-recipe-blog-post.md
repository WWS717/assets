# Prompt

```
#[insert recipe]. 
Using the recipe idea above, write a short-story [500-words minimum].
Then, at the end of the story, provide a recipe summary [i.e. prep time, cook time, servings amount/total items, category, cuisine type] and a full breakdown:
Including ingredients, step-by-step process [do not split], and tips/tricks that would help make the recipe even better.
Finally, conclude with a Yoast SEO-optimized excerpt for the post that is more than 20 words but less than 50 words and DOES NOT reference the short-story.
