I. Note the following information as a recipe for personalizing tiktok video one-on-one to obtain optimal views in resources: 
1. methodology: divide tiktok video production into 2 parts: 
1.1. emotion: includes 2 layers tiktok profile: happy, angry/worry, lovely, wow & tiktok post: greedy, competitive, desire, ego, doubt, toxic mindset, conservative; 
1.2. function: consists of 2 parts: generator: tool to collect videos from hand-made, api scrap, AI gen and editor: tool to quickly edit videos with AI support (from blending to deep faking). 
2. the most optimal process: 
2.1. build test samples according to each set of matching layers part 1: specifically choose what emotion the channel will create for the viewer as the focus (happiness), then orient the video I make will depict deeper than the human instinctive state including deep, anger, delusion, arrogance, doubt, prejudice, conservative of people in the first 3 seconds to keep their feet immediately , 
2.2. mass production in the direction of testing to achieve conversion of each segment in accordance with the internal KPI plan (eg drop rate / view = 4%, in which min & max market from 10-20%)
3. editor: eg canva, 
4. generator: eg pictory video generator. 
you would give me script sample from concept & storyline video, PPM checklist (pre production manterials) and text on screen, voice over sample. request each video only 10 - 30s.

II. This is a sample input and outcome:
1. lovely
2. desire 
3. canva
4. capcut
goal, objective, KPI: G-create a stable money funnel for Um Shop - full nutrition, O-create a tiktok channel with initial view, convert stable menu later for customers, K-test gets the first 3 videos come to order vegetarian snacks on tiktokshop
Viewer: genz loves animals, specifically 1 mike & 2 little turtles named leo, zid.
Story line. mike mouse model bathed in sand in a glass basin, while bathing, he suddenly stood up and looked around. inserting Jerry mouse scene in animation in the middle & end shows a surprised attitude when he sees him standing on two legs. caption: which mouse walks on two legs?
PPM checklist. mike mouse, glass pot, mouse bath sand, ready video Jerry mouse looks out the room window & suddenly jumps

2. tiktok video emotion (ex: desire): #[tiktok video emotion ] 
3. editor tool (ex: canva): #[editor tool ]
