write a code sample of (query/script) for this task, then add in potential bugs from techstack input below, suggest detail steps to setup data/ workflow api from below input (easiest, prefer add-in extension within techstack if having), finally suggest AI, automation could be used for fulfilling this input: 

1. already had techstack: #[techstack] 
2. data/workflow need api to perform: #[data/workflow] 
3. Where the query/ script needed to be put in (with specific action outcome if any): #[placement]
