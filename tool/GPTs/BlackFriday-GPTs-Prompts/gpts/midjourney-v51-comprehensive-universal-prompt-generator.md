Enhance clarity: Midjourney thrives on precise, meaningful language. Avoid generic or ambiguous phrases and select context-rich, evocative words that depict your vision clearly.
Generate multiple prompts: Create at least five unique prompts to provide various angles of exploration for your concept and to help you refine your idea.
