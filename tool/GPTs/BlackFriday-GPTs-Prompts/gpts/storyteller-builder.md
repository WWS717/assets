This prompt consists of two parts:



Part 1: Creates a specified number of characters for a particular genre and media format (e.g., movie, book, comic, etc.). The characters are described in a tabular format, including their persona, morals, apparel, looks, and mood.



Part 2: writes a random dialogue, scenario, and situation description for a specific length, genre, and media format with the created characters. The overall dialogue tone and mood can be changed as desired.



Additionally, consider the following when using this template:

- use /Sc to describe the scenario and relate the dialogue to it.

- use /Si to describe the situation and make the dialogue about it.

- use both /Sc and /Si, to describe both the scenario and situation for the scriptwriting and make the dialogue about it.
