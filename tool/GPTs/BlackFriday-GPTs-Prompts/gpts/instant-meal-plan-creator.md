This meal plan creator will quickly outline a customizable plan and shopping list based on your specific needs. Under 'Special Diet Needs', elaborate on any dietary restrictions, foods to avoid, or must-haves in your meal plan. For example, "This meal plan should be vegan, and include a cup of black coffee every day. It should also avoid peanut butter."



Once the initial response is created, feel free to push ChatGPT to tweak the plan to better fit your needs by asking it to replace certain meals or add/remove days.
