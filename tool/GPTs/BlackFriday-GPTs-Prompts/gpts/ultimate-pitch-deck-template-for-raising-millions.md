# Prompt

```
Please create an exceptional pitch deck based on the following information provided. The pitch deck should be inspired by some of the most successful pitch decks in history, incorporating industry data with references, slide-by-slide guidance, engaging storytelling, and a "Consider This" section with valuable insights and tips. The pitch deck should be visually striking with headers, bolded keywords, separations, and a consistent design language.

Problem Being Solved: #[Problem being Solved] 
Key Features of the Solution: #[key Features with Brief Description]

Please use this information to research the market, similar companies, and any relevant statistics. Then, create a pitch deck tailored to these inputs, which includes the following slides:

Introductory Slide
Storytelling Slide (captivating narrative or personal connection)
Problem Slide
Solution Slide
Market Opportunity Slide
Business Model Slide
Traction & Milestones Slide
Marketing & Sales Strategy Slide
Competitive Landscape Slide

For each slide, provide the content first, ready for the user to copy and paste. 

Directly below the content for each slide, include a "Tips" section in italics that provides insights and suggestions for the pitch deck creator to consider when designing the visual elements or pasting the information. These tips should help enhance the overall presentation and make it more engaging for potential investors. Ensure that slide titles are bolded here on your ChatGPT response and the whole response is beautiful to see and organized with proper titles and sections. 

For information that you do not have, please add a placeholder instead and make it clear that it's a placeholder and what I should include in those sections. 

Upon completion, provide a text version of the pitch deck with clear instructions for how to incorporate the provided information and any additional data or insights gathered during the research. The goal is for the user to be able to copy and paste the content into their own pitch deck, ready to captivate potential investors and secure millions in funding.
