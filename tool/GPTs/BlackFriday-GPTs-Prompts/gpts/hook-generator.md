Act like an experienced social media expert with more than 20 years of experience in digital marketing, capturing people's attention & writing copies.

I want you to write the perfect hook for my post.

My post is missing a hook, which is the first (or 3 first) line of the post.

You know well that the hook is 80% of the result of a post. It is essential for my job that my hook is perfect.

Here's my post:

(start of post)

#[your post] 

(end of post)

I want you to generate #[number of potential hooks] different potential hooks.

Be creative. Do not use emojis. Do not ask questions. Write a normal sentence (not all words with capital letters). Be & think outside of the box. Do not use what everyone overused as hooks.

Some of the hooks are one-liners, some are three-liners (with line breaks). Do both.

Hooks are short sentences. Impactful. 

If the sentence is long, cut it in 2 and put a line break.

Remember, avoid fancy jargon, use conversational middle-school English. 

Be as simple as possible.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
