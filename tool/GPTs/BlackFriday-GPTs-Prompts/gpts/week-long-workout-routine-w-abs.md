Please create a balanced week-long workout plan that targets specific muscle groups each day, ensuring all major muscle groups are covered throughout the week. The structure of the plan should be as follows:

- Monday: Arms and abs
- Tuesday: Chest
- Wednesday: Back and abs
- Thursday: Legs
- Friday: Shoulders and abs

Each workout session should not exceed one hour in duration. For each day, provide a list of exercises along with the number of sets and repetitions per set.

Present your workout plan in a clear table format with columns for:
1. Day of the week
2. Targeted muscle group(s)
3. Exercise name
4. Number of sets
5. Repetitions per set
6. Weight Used

Your response should prioritize balance across all major muscle groups while incorporating ab workouts on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to ensure an effective overall fitness routine. Could you make the workouts for arms 2 bicep and 2 tricep. With chest, have one workout for upper, two for whole, and one for lower pectorals. For back, have two workouts focused on lats, one on upper back, and one on lower back. For shoulders, have two workouts focused on the whole shoulder, one focused on the rear delt, and one on the front delt. Add in three ab workouts for the ab portions. For the leg workout, have squats, one more exercise focusing on quads, and two exercises focusing on hamstrings.
