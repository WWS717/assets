1Ô∏è‚É£ Result 1: We need to define our target demographic's dream outcome. Our target demographic is #[Targetdemographic], their dream outcome should look something like this:

They want #[Outcome 1] 

They want #[Outcome 2] 

They want #[Outcome 3] 

Please synthesize these points into a concise and tangible dream outcome and include any additional outcomes they might want that are related to the list I provided.

‚ö°Ô∏è

2Ô∏è‚É£ Result 2: Now, we need to define EVERY problem our target demographic (#[Targetdemographic]) may encounter along the way to their dream outcome. Create an exhaustive list of every possible problem someone might encounter while trying to achieve the outcomes above. Include any things that keep them up at night, what they have tried before that hasn't worked, and what they consider risks.

‚ö°Ô∏è

3Ô∏è‚É£ Result 3: List 3 solutions for each of these problems:

1. Problem 1

2. Problem 2

3. Problem 3

The solutions are concrete things I could sell to our target demographic (#Target Demographic) to fix the problems. 

The group ratio should be 1 to many, I don't want to offer 1 on 1 or group coaching sessions.

They will be completing all the solutions on their own or with light ongoing support from me.

The solutions should be online and be text, SAAS, membership, agency, or recorded video-based.

The solutions should be available to users 24/7 after the initial delivery.

Every solution doesn't need to be an online course, resource library, community, and downloadable exercises. Remember to diversify and offer unique solutions to the problems. Maximize your creativity when creating solutions.

The solutions should be in list form and the problems in your response should be bolded.

Believable - Dream outcome & perceived likelihood of achievement: Present the desired outcome as both aspirational and achievable. Balance the excitement of the dream outcome with realistic expectations to build trust.

Time delay & effort + sacrifice: Acknowledge any necessary time, effort, or sacrifices that the client may need to invest. This helps manage expectations and demonstrates your transparency.

Pricing / Investment: Clearly state the pricing or investment required for your offer. Consider offering multiple price points or tiered options to cater to different client budgets and needs. Consider monthly recurring revenue.

Great Offer Names: Choose an offer name that is memorable, attention-grabbing, and resonates with your target audience. Consider elements like rhyme, rhythm, alliteration, and association to make it more engaging.
