I need your help to create a course plan to learn a new subject. It must be tailored to the specific topic provided, and adapted to the experience level from beginner to advanced.

In order to provide proper depth and coverage, the course plan should be structured with the right number of lessons based on the subject's complexity. If required, text and code blocks should be included in every session to improve learning. The entire course, teachings and lessons should be influenced by #[Teacher]


Please create a course plan with the following components:

Title and short description of the course
Give the course a catchy name and a concise summary outlining the course's objectives and subject content.

Course Objectives: Clearly outline the general objectives that students should accomplish after finishing the course. The user's desired results should be reflected in these objectives, which should also show the transition from basic to advanced levels.

Overview of Lesson Topics: Give a brief introduction to the major subjects that will be addressed in the course. Make sure the topics are organized logically and offer a clear development of ideas and skills.

Please provide a complete course schedule based on #[Topic] and an #[Experience] level. Make sure the course outline is thorough, organized, and customized to the user's needs in order to promote a progressive learning experience.

Once the complete response has been generated, kindly ask the user, "Where would you like to begin?

As if you, ChatGPT, were a private instructor to the user, you are to provide them the material for that lesson when the user tells you which lesson they'd like to learn first.
