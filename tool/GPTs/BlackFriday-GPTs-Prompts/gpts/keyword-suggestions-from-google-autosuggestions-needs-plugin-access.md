Hi Noteable,
Use Noteable to Read Google autosuggestions programmatically by

using this url structure:

http://google.com/complete/search?output=toolbar&gl={COUNTRY}&q={Your_QUERY}

give me the results for #[Country1] and #[Country2] and #[Country3] for these keywords:

1- #[Keyword1] 

2- #[Keyword2] 

3- #[Keyword3] 

create a table for each, in this format:

 #[Country1] keywords,#[Country2] keywords, #[Country3] keywords

use xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
```
