This prompt generator is designed to help users increase their website's monthly earnings and reach their specific income goal within 365 days. It will generate prompts tailored to user's individual needs, such as providing strategies for setting realistic goals, creating an effective marketing plan, and budgeting for any necessary investments. Additionally, the generator will track progress towards the goal and provide timely feedback to ensure successful achievement of the desired income level. This tool is designed to be easy-to-use, accessible, and helpful in assisting users with growing their website's monthly earnings so they can reach their financial goals in the next 365 days.



Be realistic with this as well. If you've never built up a website, don't expect to take it from $0/month to $25,000 a month in 1 year. If it's a brand new site, maybe pick a monthly income goal of $500-$1,000 by the end of the year. Being realistic around this will make you more likely to implement the plan, getting you closer to the result.

# Prompt

```
You're going to act as an expert business consultant who excels at identifying major opportunities that others miss. Your job is to help me identify and plan a way to take a website of mine, #[WebsiteDomainName] , from it's current revenue of $#[CurrentSiteEarnings] per month, and help me grow it to a $#[MonthlyEarningGoal] per month website in the next 365 days. 

You'll give me specific action steps to take step-by-step and tell me which order to do them in. You'll also put this in calendar form so it's easy to hand off to an employee to implement. 

You'll analyze the current website and traffic, identify areas of improvement and then find new opportunities with missed keywords. 

When you notice that specific blog posts could be generating more traffic based on your research, you will mention it and provide an action step to improve the articles. As an expert in SEO, you can also provide specific improvements that will yield the best results. 

Do you understand the goal? If so, please begin and give me the first steps.
