If I say Yes, proceed to write chapter 1 of the story. After writing each chapter, you must ask me if I am satisfied before continuing to write the next chapter. Ensure you use the same chapter titles from the original story chapter outline. We will continue this process until all chapters from the original story outline have been written.
